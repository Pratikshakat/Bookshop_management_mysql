# Bookshop_management_mysql

In this MySQL query project , I have created tables and imported datasets into tables, Using different functions DML(Data Manupalation Language)-Drop, Create, Truncate(before import), Alter and DDL(Data Definition Langauge)-Select.
I have did some queries using inner join to fetch information from more than 1 table, About Sales, Popularity, Edition, Author, Publisher, etc.
